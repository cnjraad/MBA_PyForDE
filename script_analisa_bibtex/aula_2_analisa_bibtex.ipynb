Practical applications of electroholography require computer generated hologram (CGH) patterns of between 10/sup 9/ to 10/sup 10/ pixels to be calculated and displayed at interactive rates. These pixel counts are necessary in order to generate images which are both big enough (upwards of 300 mm width) and possess a large enough field of view (FOV) to permit simultaneous, multiuser viewing. Advances in several key areas may now make such high performance electroholographic systems practical in the near future.

In the past model analysis, it was shown that the incentive to renew a house becomes smaller with the age of owners, and becomes bigger with the history of a house. However, it was not clear if actual owners make decision on renewal of their own houses based on the recognition of degradation risk. Even if owners know that their houses are dangerous, they may not implement any measures. It is also necessary to expand the analysis to incorporate decisions on the repairing that improves safety of a house and costs lower than renewal. In this study, we tried to specify the critical factors that affect owners' decision on repairing and renewal. We especially focus on two temporal properties, age of an owner and history of a house. First, model analysis on renewal is expanded to apply to more general situations. Second, survey was carried out to examine appropriateness of the models in Yamaguchi City, Japan. Based on the collected data, the parameters for the binary logit model were estimated and it was proved that owners' age affects their decision and the effects of the history of houses are not clear.\",\n",

Self-organizing maps (SOM) were used to create subsets of companies from the original database. The method has been implemented in Java software with a web front-end to perform the computer evaluation of the technique. The method is validated on a data set of 459 companies collected by French students. Using the clustering software we found four subsets, which correspond to the economic theory of 'worlds of production': interpersonal, industrial, immaterial and merchant world.\",\n",

Scope of the JANUS payload is the demonstration of the connection of the on-board ISS network, accessed by the ISS experiments, to an experiment ground facility, to create a direct link to ground in W band, directly controlled by the experimenters. JANUS has been conceived as a modular mission, in which the technological and scientific development can be stretched in flexible way and will realize two different experiments: 1) the data communication experiment, aiming at the interactive data transfer between the ISS and an Earth terminal. 2) The propagation experiment, which has been conceived by adding the TX section at W band, thus allowing characterizing the V and W band transmission channel, today largely unknown. The paper describes the conceived system architecture and the architecture solutions implemented on-board and on-ground to take advantage of parallel industry development contracts undertaken or in progress by means of ASI founds. Other interesting aspects are: 1) use of an oscillator architecture based on a common reference source, 2) use of a solid state phase locked local oscillator at a frequency of 89.2 GHz, 3) utilization of a common high quality phase noise characteristics first local oscillator (PLDRO) operated at 6.3 GHz for two TX plus RX chains 4) use, as second local oscillators, of two different dielectric resonator oscillators (PLDRO) at 24.3 GHz for the 37.9 GHz transmitter chain and 36.4 GHz for the 50 GHz receiving chain and 4) realization of a solid state 83.9 GHz power amplifier based on the use of a metamorphic InP based MMIC modules.',\n",

       "  \"During the Cassini solar conjunction experiment, radio-metric data have been used to measure the space components of the sun's metric tensor. In the parameterized post-newtonian formalism, this quantity is controlled by a parameter (/spl gamma/) which is unity in General Relativity but may assume slightly different values in other metric theories of gravity. The measurement of /spl gamma/ with Cassini is based upon a new observable quantity: the frequency shift induced on a radio wave when the spacecraft is near solar conjunction. The calibration of the large frequency fluctuations induced by the solar corona, necessary in order to guarantee the required signal stability, is performed using the novel Cassini radio frequency system, based on a multifrequency link. In this paper the operations performed and the results obtained from the preliminary analysis of the June-July 2002 Cassini solar conjunction data are described. The multifrequency link plasma calibration scheme is also illustrated along with the techniques for the reduction of the non-dispersive, tropospheric effects. The high quality of the calibrated Doppler data indicates that the experiment provides a high accuracy test of general relativity.\",\n",

       "  'One of the key performance metrics for satellite constellations is the statistics of the visibility periods between the satellites and points on the ground. Associated with this are other desirable communications statistics such as data through-put, link qualities, etc. Typically, the computation of coverage statistics requires the propagation of the trajectories. For orbits with non-repeating ground tracks, this may require orbit propagation for tens of years per spacecraft. Lo (1994) proposed an approach using ergodic theory which replaced the need to compute the statistics from integrated trajectories by a definite integral over the circular region of the elevation mask of a point on the ground. The effects of J2 due to the non-spherical shape of the Earth are included in the definite integral. The definite integral can be implemented in Excel for quick trade studies. But the simple geometric methods used to derive the integral for circular orbits cannot be readily extended to elliptical orbits. In This work a new algorithm using differential geometry enables us to extend this theory to elliptical orbits.',\n",

       "  'The space vehicles require more and more processing capabilities. This to obtain different advantages: device flexibility, better employment of the frequency spectrum, improving quality and reliability of transmission, preprocessing of the captured data, and so on. These advantages are obtained by implementing onboard complex algorithms. An advantageous realization of these algorithms can be obtained by using residue number system (RNS) arithmetic. The use of the RNS arithmetic requires a complex conversion from the binary representation to the RNS representation. This work describes a new approach to this last problem. A direct analog to RNS converter (ARC) architecture is proposed. This architecture follows from a new further interpretation of the RNS: instead of an elaboration tool this arithmetic is viewed as a measurement tool. The principle used can be considered an RNS extension of the caliper rule. With respect to other realizations already published on S. Mandyam and T. Stouraitis (1990), T. Stouraitis (1992) and D.

       "  \"Aviation industries in United States and in Europe are undergoing a major paradigm shift in the introduction of new network technologies. In the US, NASA is also actively investigating the feasibility of IPv6 based networks for the aviation needs of the United States. In Europe, the Eurocontrol lead, Internet protocol for aviation exchange (iPAX) Working Group is actively investigating the various ways of migrating the aviation authorities backbone infrastructure from X.25 based networks to an IPv6 based network. For the last 15 years, the global aviation community has pursued the development and implementation of an industry-specific set of communications standards known as the aeronautical telecommunications network (ATN). These standards are now beginning to affect the emerging military global air traffic management (GATM) community as well as the commercial air transport community. Efforts are continuing to gain a full understanding of the differences and similarities between ATN and Internet architectures as related to communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) infrastructure choices. This research paper describes the implementation of the IPv6 testbed at Computer Networks &amp; Software, Inc. and it's interface connection mechanism to Eurocontrol and NASA's (Cleveland) testbed in the first phase of the project. In the second phase this research work investigates the performance issues of aviation applications such as controller to pilot data link communication (CPDLC), on an IPv6 based backbone network. Aviation applications are grouped into different priority levels. Desired quality of service (QoS) to each priority level is implemented via Diffserv implementation. This research work looks into the possibility of providing similar QoS performance for aviation application in an IPv6 network as is provided in an ATN based network. The testbed consists of three autonomous systems. The autonomous system represents CNS domain, NASA domain and a EUROCONTROL domain. The primary mode of connection between CNS IPv6 testbed and NASA and EUROCONTROL IPv6 testbed is initially a set of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. The aviation application under test (CPDLC) consists of two processes running on different IPv6 enabled machines. These processes communicate with each other over the IPv6 network. One machine resides on the CNS portion of the testbed and other may reside in NASA (Cleveland) and/or in Eurocontrol. The IPv6 packets between Eurocontrol, NASA and CNS testbeds would be carried on IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. We present some results, which suggest that IPv6 QoS has matured enough, so as to provide the QoS service, which is similar in capability to die ATN architecture. We implemented three basic priorities of flow: (1) command &amp; control; (2) surveillance; and (3) general traffic. Various parameters like throughput, packet loss and delay are investigated. The results are analyzed to get a conceptual view of the effect of IPv6 based network on the aviation applications.\",\n",

THOR consists of airborne terminals networked to form a communications backbone transmitting and receiving data at 2.5Gbps as well as passive optical terminals connected as high speed edge devices with a data rate of 200Mbps. The operational objective is to enable high data rate communications between a combat theater command post and an edge terminal linked to the global information grid (GIG) located outside of theater. DARPA investments were made in compact electro-optic beam steering devices to decrease the size and weight of optical terminals, high-speed high sensitivity (-47dBm) detectors, and high power (50W) modulating laser sources. Passive optical terminal technology investments focused on highspeed modulating quantum well focal plane arrays for integration with wide field of view +/-15 degree cat's eye optical systems to enable high speed modulating retro reflectors. Networking technologies included protocol assessments and quality of service algorithms to maintain low latency data transfer over unreliable optical data channels while maintaining data rates in the 2.5Gbps range.

The first instrument (HST1) has been operating for several years aboard multiple platforms, and a sizable archive of imagery has been generated. Using this archive as a baseline, HST2 data have been evaluated to measure expected performance gains versus actual gains. The basic instrument specifications remain unchanged: 227 unique spectral channels from 450-2450nm with 8-12nm FWHM, 1 milliradian IFOV, 256 element cross-track scanning, up to 14 bit digitization, and beam steering optics for image stabilization. Notable changes in HST2 include AR coating of the SWIR FPA, miniaturization of the electronics, and integration of control and data processing computers within the sensor so that it may be used in a pod or UAV. Sufficiently clear data over a single study area does not exist, so data from the spectrally similar areas of Cuprite and Goldfield, Nevada are used to compare the performance of the two instruments. While AR coating of the SWIR focal plane and other improvements to HST2 have improved signal-to-noise performance, these gains are traded off for a shorter integration time allowing for faster and a greater volume of data collection. An attempt to objectively measure spectral image data quality using spectral similarity values and determining the inherent dimensionality of the data reveal similar spectral performance of the instruments under present operational modes.',\n",

       "  'The areas of open pitting and strip mining are common methods of ore extraction in the wide-area disseminated gold and porphyry copper deposits in the Western United States. The processes of open-pitting remove much of the surface cover in the affected areas and expose geologic features of interest at various depths, often at great detail and can yield clues to the formation of the ore deposit as a whole. Using high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired over several open pit mines (Sacaton Pit, AZ; Borax Pit, CA) it is possible to delineate the principal elements of geologic diversity: veins, contacts, mineralization host rocks and various zones of hydrothermal alteration on the basis of their characteristic spectral absorption features. Another useful element of hyperspectral remote sensing over mining operations is general characterization of the landscape cover types and mineralization as a whole, prior to mine development for design of life cycle of mine reclamation, monitoring the preservation of key environmental attributes during mine development and finally monitoring the effectiveness of environmental remediation during mine closure. Automated classification of geologic/landscape features using radiance data aids in generation of distribution maps for particular features (i.e. alteration type) whereas analysis of reflectance data allows for abundance mapping. The combined process greatly improves the overall quality of the acquired data, reduces the overall processing time for the analysis of hyperspectral imagery and may be a useful tool application of remote sensing in geological/geophysical surveying and exploration worldwide.',\n",

       "  'This paper discusses the development of a method to reduce the transient effects on piezoelectric pressure transducers used in the measurement of blast overpressure produced by non-conventional explosives. This method was developed during testing of high-energy and non-conventional explosives at the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) on the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. There are two major contributors that negatively affect the quality of data gathered in the measurement of blast overpressures using piezoelectric pressure transducers. These undesirable effects are thermal and photoelectric transients generated in the explosive blast. These transients were found to obscure the data generated by causing a non-positive amplitude shift in the pressure-time curves when trying to measure the performance of non-conventional explosives. This paper explores the phenomenon in detail, utilizing graphical data derived from laboratory experiments to explain the problem and to illustrate how the use of this method may improve blast measurements.',\n",

Over the past decade, an research and development (R&amp;D) robust laser interferometer (RLI) has been employed in a variety of aviation component health measurement situations, and in a variety of functional measurement situations of potential significance for aviation system health. Examples of RLI measurement data are taken from gearbox and turbine jet engine test cell measurements and from laboratory measurements that involve both controlled and empirical experiments. Selected simulation data is also used to validate aspects of the differences in performance that are anticipated when comparing both a quality contact (accelerometer) system implementation and the non-contact (RLI) measurement system. Dynamic and environmental parameters of concern were selected from an article by Jon Wilson in Sensor Magazine (March 1999) entitled \"Dynamic and Environmental Effects on Performance Parameters\". The dynamic parameters include: sensitivity/signal-to-noise; dynamic range; amplitude frequency response; phase frequency response; amplitude non-linearity; transverse sensitivity; and mass and size. The environmental parameters include: temperature; thermal transmit sensitivity; base strain sensitivity; electromagnetic sensitivity; acoustic sensitivity; radioactive environments; humidity; grounding/electrical isolation; and placebo/noise monitor control. Additionally, other factors are addressed including bandpass differences in terms of total bandpass, high frequency performance and low frequency performance. Observations are also included that address potential user interest beyond performance.

The collaborative work has built on BAE systems vast experience of operational load monitoring (OLM) that has spanned more than 30 years. The collaborative work has also built on the unique experience of Smiths over the past 20 years that has produced automatic data correction algorithms, mathematical networks (MNs), dynamic models and flight and usage management software (FUMS/spl trade/). Smiths and BAE systems have been also carrying out extensive investigations that lead to establishing and agreeing a route for qualifying/certifying AI based systems, an essential work element to avoid a delay in introducing SPHM into service use. The investigations have covered assessing the adequacy and quality of the truth data required to train/configure an AI method. They have also addressed the regulatory authority (RA) concern that any volume of data gathered to train an AI method would not capture the truth and some operations/configurations may produce novel data outside the training data.

       "  \"We consider the scheduling of transmissions from an energy limited Mars lander to a Mars orbiter. Typically, the channel quality of the Mars proximity links is time-varying due to orbital dynamics, multi-path effects and the antenna positioning on the lander. Since the channel state determines the throughput obtained per unit of energy transmitted, it is desirable to select when, and at what data rate, to transmit based on channel conditions. In this paper we consider the dual problem of maximizing the throughput of a lander that has a limited amount of energy to be used for transmission; and minimizing the energy consumption used for transmission of data subject to delay constraints. In (Tarello et al., 2005) it was shown, using techniques from dynamic programming, that energy efficiency can be significantly improved through an adaptive rate and power allocation scheme. We apply the policies developed in (Tarello et al., 2005) to the Mars proximity link and compare them with scheduling algorithms presently in use for proximity links. Our simulations, using channel measurement data obtained from NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter and the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project, show over an order of magnitude increase in throughput and decrease in energy consumption through the use of the dynamic programming based rate and power adaptation scheme\",\n",

The project was started in August 2001 at Surrey Satellite Technologies Limited (SSTL)'s facilities in Guildford, UK and BILSAT-1 was launched successfully from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia in 27 September 2003. The main objective of the mission is remote sensing. The communications subsystem is a core system for Earth observation satellite. It is generally used for telemetry/telecommand signaling, software uploading and image/data transfer. The BILSAT-1 communications subsystem is composed of VHF/UHF (amateur space band) and S-Band (commercial space band). Link analysis is essential for design of any satellite communications subsystem to observe the quality of the link. The link budget should be calculated; the positive link margin has to be guaranteed at all elevation angles that the proposed design requires before the actual manufacturing process starts. For BILSAT-1 communications subsystem, the link budget calculator program has been developed at pre-design phase. The program calculates the received Eb/No and the required Eb/No, and gives the difference as the link margin with respect to the elevation angles. The communications subsystem parameters such as RF output power, antenna size/type, power consumption etc. both at ground station and on board have been optimized according to the simulated links. These parameters ultimately effects overall project cost and time schedule. Also, to aid pre-launch/in-orbit test and to observe in-orbit link quality, some status points have been made available at BILSAT-1 satellite telemetry system. The measurements include a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) that provides an indication of the total signal power received. By using this data, the reliability of the link budget calculator program can be verified. In this paper, the above-mentioned link budget calculator program will be presented and the calculated and the actual link margins will be given and compared\",\n",

       "  'Domain-specific program synthesis can automatically generate high quality code in complex domains from succinct specifications, but the range of programs which can be generated by a given synthesis system is typically narrow. Obtaining code which falls outside this narrow scope necessitates either 1) extension of the code generator, which is usually very expensive, or 2) manual modification of the generated code, which is often difficult and which must be redone whenever changes are made to the program specification. In this paper, we describe adaptations and extensions of the AUTOFILTER Kalman filter synthesis system which greatly extend the range of programs which can be generated. Users augment the input specification with a specification of code fragments and how those fragments should interleave with or replace parts of the synthesized filter. This allows users to generate a much wider range of programs without their needing to modify the synthesis system or edit generated code. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to the synthesis of a complex state estimator which combines code from several Kalman filters with user-specified code. The work described in this paper allows the complex design decisions necessary for real-world applications to be reflected in the synthesized code. When executed on simulated input data, the generated state estimator was found to produce comparable estimates to those produced by a hand-coded estimator',\n",

The approach selected was to compare the TEAMS-RT reasoner's computational performance and diagnostic accuracy against a proven Pratt &amp; Whitney's (P&amp;W) legacy reasoner. The model was auto-generated from high quality information on LRC/module failure modes and rates from the FMECA data, and the relationship between individual failure modes and the built-in fault codes issued by the engine's electronic controls. The data provided by P&amp;W contained fault-test dependency and failure rate data in a spreadsheet format, which was used to generate the TEAMS-RT model. P&amp;W also supplied a rich set of test cases that were used to exercise the TEAMS-RT EHM solution. The objectives of the study were two-fold. The first objective was to use the test cases to validate the automatic model generation process and the diagnostic accuracy of a COTS reasoner (TEAMS-RT) against a proven legacy diagnosis system currently in use by the air force. It was, therefore, important to demonstrate that for the same test cases, the TEAMS-RT results were nearly identical to the ones produced by the reference reasoner. Thus, a secondary goal was to tweak the TEAMS-RT algorithm to mimic the performance of the reference reasoner. The second objective was to investigate ways to improve on the reasoning accuracy beyond that of the reference reasoner. The results show a slight improvement in diagnostic accuracy and substantial improvement in computational performance by the TEAMS-RT reasoner.

       "  \"To meet operational demands for vertically-resolved atmospheric winds, we propose a wide-swath multiangle stereo imaging system that could be easily integrated into future satellite platforms. The concept uses techniques proven with the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument, currently flying in polar low-Earth orbit (LEO) on NASA's Terra satellite. MISR has demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining accurate stereophotogrammetric retrievals of cloud and aerosol plume heights and height-resolved cloud-tracked wind vectors. MISR obtains multiangle imagery with along-track pointing angles ranging from nadir to 70deg forward and backward of nadir and makes use of the several-minute time delay among a triplet of multiangle views to separate the effects of wind displacement from height-induced stereoscopic parallax. Careful attention to multiangle image co-registration (crucial for obtaining accurate wind retrievals) has led to wind estimates that exhibit negligible bias relative to reanalysis data. The root-mean-square uncertainty in speed is estimated to be in the 1-3 m/sec range, depending on whether the wind component is parallel or perpendicular to the flight direction and on the degree of quality control applied. The uncertainty in height assignment is on the order of 300 mum. Comparison of results from a forward-viewing angle triplet with independent retrievals from a backward-viewing triplet provides an important control on retrieval quality. A key attribute of the stereophotogrammetric approach to retrieving cloud heights (and winds) is that the technique is purely geometric. Accurate radiometric calibration is not required, thereby enabling significant simplification of a future instrument dedicated to stereo height and wind retrievals. Furthermore, the approach is insensitive to atmospheric temperature profiles and cloud emissivities, and provides data of consistent quality at all latitudes from polar orbit. It is also purely passive, so sensor lifetime is not a major issue. Since the technique relies on pattern matching, only a single mid-visible spectral band is required (a separate thermal infrared band, e.g., at 3.7 mum, would be needed in order to acquire measurements at night). Future improvements in computer capability will enable improved pattern-matching algorithms that could be implemented operationally. This simple, compact, and relatively inexpensive concept would assist numerical weather prediction models by retrieving cloud-motion vector winds in traditionally data-sparse areas (mid-oceans and high latitudes), would continue the unique data record begun with MISR by establishing long-term cloud-top height and cloud-motion wind monitoring with sensitivities capable of detecting atmospheric response to climate forcings, and would provide global measurements of the injection and transport heights of distinct aerosol plumes from wildfires, dust storms, and volcanic eruptions.\",\n",

       "  'The Mars reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, USA, aboard an Atlas V-401 launch vehicle on August 12, 2005. The MRO spacecraft carries a very sophisticated scientific payload. Its primary science mission is to to provide global, regional survey, and targeted observations from a low-altitude orbit for one Martian year (687 Earth days). After a seven-month interplanetary transit, the spacecraft fired its six main engines and established a highly elliptical capture orbit at Mars. During the post Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) early check-out period, four instruments acquired engineering-quality data. This was followed by five months of aerobraking operations. After aerobraking was terminated, a series of propulsive maneuvers were used to establish the desired low-altitude science orbit. As the spacecraft is readied for its primary science mission, spacecraft and instrument checkout and deployment activities have continued. After the science phase is completed, the orbiter will provide telecommunications support for future Mars missions. This paper provides a status of the actual mission to date (through October 2006) and briefly describes the planned operations for the upcoming science mission.',\n",

       "  'Reliable, secure and effective communication between a spacecraft and the ground station, or between multiple spacecraft is central to all space missions. Smooth control of spacecraft and the downlink of mission and science data rely heavily on reliable means of communication. Moreover, heightened needs for operations security in recent years add complexity to communication system requirements. The communication system, therefore, is a highly safety and mission critical component. A single successful malicious attack or a flaw in the code can have serious consequences that put the mission or even human life at risk. We are integrating and adapting a set of existing tools in order to provide a unified end-to-end approach to the design, analysis, implementation, and certification of space communication software. Our tools are based upon rigorous logical and mathematical foundations, and are capable of automatically generating high-quality communication software from a high-level model. Automatic, tamper-proof formal certification techniques are used to provide explicit guarantees about important reliability and security properties and the absence of implementation errors.',\n",

       "  'Normal design practice is to decouple the design of applications using a network from the design of the network itself. Designers optimize network performance by only focusing on network transport layer mechanisms for robustness (connectivity), efficiency (throughput), and speed of service (latency). Applications offer loads to the network and rely on the QoS function in the network to prioritize the traffic flows. By contrast, network centric operations focus on application layer features like situation awareness and synchronization to enhance force effectiveness. Therefore, in contrast to enterprise networks in which QoS processes messages based on fixed priorities by data type, in mission orientated MANET, QoS must be a cooperative function between application and network resource management that uses dynamic priority allocations derived from task priorities established by commanders within the echelon hierarchies.',\n",

In this paper, the feasibility of the overlay concept is evaluated by simulations of the physical and higher layers as well as by laboratory measurements with a demonstrator. Simulation results show that the B-VHF overlay system works in presence of interference from legacy VHF systems. The protocol is designed to allow using the available resources very efficiently and to provide voice and data services with the required quality of service. In addition, the impact of mutual interference between the B-VHF system and legacy VHF systems is evaluated in laboratory test with a simplified B-VHF demonstrator and commercial VHF radios.',\n",

       "  \"In this paper we present an online approach for joint detection and tracking for multiple targets using variable rate particle filters (VRPFs). Unlike conventional models and particle filters, the proposed method utilises the applied forces (tangential and radial components) to model target motions and does not assume the hidden state to change at the same rate as the observations. In effect not only does the proposed method enable us to model parsimoniously the manoeuvring behaviours of targets with a single dynamical model but it also provides a more efficient framework for recursive estimation of the targets' positions since much fewer states will be estimated. In addition, a target detection/termination module will be integrated in the proposed method in which a track initiation, termination, or maintenance move is randomly executed using Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. To model a more realistic observation environment Poisson process is chosen for all target originating and spurious measurements. Unlike other observation models, the proposed model does not require extensive computation for data association between active targets and observations, prior to target state estimation, as a result. To improve the quality of the particles we adopt a data-dependent importance sampling strategy in which the latest observations are involved when new particles are updated. This enables the target states to be updated as new observations arrive while keeping the number of states sufficiently low to track the manoeuvres of the targets. Computer simulations demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for detecting and tracking multiple highly manoeuverable targets in a hostile environment with high clutter density and low detection probability.\",\n",

Even with the increase of the automation in the software development activities, the resources stay scarce. As a consequence of this, there is a big interest in the metrics of software due to its potential for a better, more efficient use of the resources. Tools help and assist in the planning and in the estimation of the complexity of the applications to develop during different stage of a process. We describe a technique to define metrics using the OMG (Object Management Group) standard specification. The semantic in each metrics is specified formally with OCL (Object Constraint Language) based on OMG metamodels. For their concrete specification, we establish a series of steps that allows define uniformly each metric in the different RUP models. Furthermore, the present paper shows the use of metrics defined using this technique and the relation between data obtained from the application of the metrics to thirteen object oriented systems. They encompass projects from the capture of requirements until its implementation, showing the metrics applied in different stage of the deployment.',\n",

A regularization term is used in order to avoid the formation of very small regions, which may originate from missing or unreliable sensor data.

       "  'Two main problems must be solved in the geometric processing of satellite data: geometric registration and resampling. When the data must be geometrically registered over a reference map, and particularly when the output pixel size is not the same as the original pixel size, the quality of the resampling can determine the quality of the output, not only in the visual appearance of the image, but also in the numerically interpolated values when used in multitemporal or multisensor studies. The \"optimum\" interpolation algorithm for AVHRR data is defined over a 6/spl times/6 window in order to: consider overlapping effects among adjacent pixels. The response for each new pixel R(x, y) is determined as a linear combination of the response R/sub i/(x/sub i/y/sub i/) of the surrounding pixels in the window (i=1,36). The weighting coefficients /spl mu//sub i/ are calculated from the ground projection of the effective spatial response function for each AVHRR pixel, taking into account the particular viewing angle and geometry of the pixels on the ground. This method is intended to give an optimal interpolation of AVHRR scenes along all the scanline, in order to compensate for off-nadir radiometric alterations associated to the varying spatial resolution and the blurring introduced by the pixel overlaps. The optimum method, as mathematically defined, is highly expensive in CPU time. Then, a big effort is necessary to implement the algorithms so that they could be operationally applied. Two approaches are considered: a general numerical method and a pseudo-analytical approximation. A Landsat TM image corresponding to the same date of the AVHRR image is used to test the quality of the radiometric interpolation procedure.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>',\n",
