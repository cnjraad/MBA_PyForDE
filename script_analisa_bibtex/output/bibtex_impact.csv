;;Big Data, requirements engineering, software reference architecture, quality assurance, Big Data systems, software engineering;39;;;Big Data Systems (BDSs) are an emerging class of scalable software technologies whereby massive amounts of heterogeneous data are gathered from multiple sources, managed, analyzed (in batch, stream or hybrid fashion), and served to end-users and external applications. Such systems pose specific challenges in all phases of software development lifecycle and might become very complex by evolving data, technologies, and target value over time. Consequently, many organizations and enterprises have found it difficult to adopt BDSs. In this article, we provide insight into three major activities of software engineering in the context of BDSs as well as the choices made to tackle them regarding state-of-the-art research and industry efforts. These activities include the engineering of requirements, designing and constructing software to meet the specified requirements, and software/data quality assurance. We also disclose some open challenges of developing effective BDSs, which need attention from both researchers and practitioners.;10.1145/3408314;https://doi.org/10.1145/3408314;New York, NY, USA;Association for Computing Machinery;;2020;Big Data Systems: A Software Engineering Perspective;Davoudian, Ali and Liu, Mengchi;article;10.1145/3408314;110;sep;ACM Comput.

;;5V challenges, multimedia analysis, mobile multimedia, data mining, machine learning, Big data analytics, survey, indexing, retrieval, multimedia databases;34;;;With the proliferation of online services and mobile technologies, the world has stepped into a multimedia big data era. A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.;10.1145/3150226;https://doi.org/10.1145/3150226;New York, NY, USA;Association for Computing Machinery;;2018;Multimedia Big Data Analytics: A Survey;Pouyanfar, Samira and Yang, Yimin and Chen, Shu-Ching and Shyu, Mei-Ling and Iyengar, S.

;;cloud IoT services, cloud computing in IoT, big data 2.0, IoT big data survey, V’s challenges for IoT big data, IoT big data;59;;;Driven by the core technologies, i.e., sensor-based autonomous data acquisition and the cloud-based big data analysis, IoT automates the actuation of data-driven intelligent actions on the connected objects. This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.;10.1145/3419634;https://doi.org/10.1145/3419634;New York, NY, USA;Association for Computing Machinery;;2020;A Survey on IoT Big Data: Current Status, 13 V’s Challenges, and Future Directions;Bansal, Maggi and Chana, Inderveer and Clarke, Siobh\'{a}n;article;10.1145/3419634;131;dec;ACM Comput.

;;big data analytics application, SLA metrics, service level agreement, SLA, service layer, Big data;40;;;Recent years have witnessed the booming of big data analytical applications (BDAAs). This trend provides unrivaled opportunities to reveal the latent patterns and correlations embedded in the data, and thus productive decisions may be made. This was previously a grand challenge due to the notoriously high dimensionality and scale of big data, whereas the quality of service offered by providers is the first priority. As BDAAs are routinely deployed on Clouds with great complexities and uncertainties, it is a critical task to manage the service level agreements (SLAs) so that a high quality of service can then be guaranteed. This study performs a systematic literature review of the state of the art of SLA-specific management for Cloud-hosted BDAAs. The review surveys the challenges and contemporary approaches along this direction centering on SLA. A research taxonomy is proposed to formulate the results of the systematic literature review. A new conceptual SLA model is defined and a multi-dimensional categorization scheme is proposed on its basis to apply the SLA metrics for an in-depth understanding of managing SLAs and the motivation of trends for future research.;10.1145/3383464;https://doi.org/10.1145/3383464;New York, NY, USA;Association for Computing Machinery;;2020;SLA Management for Big Data Analytical Applications in Clouds: A Taxonomy Study;Zeng, Xuezhi and Garg, Saurabh and Barika, Mutaz and Zomaya, Albert Y. and Wang, Lizhe and Villari, Massimo and Chen, Dan and Ranjan, Rajiv;article;10.1145/3383464;46;jun;ACM Comput.

;;4V challenges, Big data analytics, survey, clinical decision support, computational health informatics, data mining, machine learning;36;;;The explosive growth and widespread accessibility of digital health data have led to a surge of research activity in the healthcare and data sciences fields. The conventional approaches for health data management have achieved limited success as they are incapable of handling the huge amount of complex data with high volume, high velocity, and high variety. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the existing challenges, techniques, and future directions for computational health informatics in the big data age, with a structured analysis of the historical and state-of-the-art methods. We have summarized the challenges into four Vs (i.e., volume, velocity, variety, and veracity) and proposed a systematic data-processing pipeline for generic big data in health informatics, covering data capturing, storing, sharing, analyzing, searching, and decision support. Specifically, numerous techniques and algorithms in machine learning are categorized and compared. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss the essential prospects lying ahead for computational health informatics in this big data age.;10.1145/2932707;https://doi.org/10.1145/2932707;New York, NY, USA;Association for Computing Machinery;;2016;Computational Health Informatics in the Big Data Age: A Survey;Fang, Ruogu and Pouyanfar, Samira and Yang, Yimin and Chen, Shu-Ching and Iyengar, S.
